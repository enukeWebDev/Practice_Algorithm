### Practice_Algorithm

I created this repository to enhance my knowledge in Data Structure 
and Algorithm (utilizing Javascript) with a firm objective of increasing  
the value of my problem solving skills. This in turn will provide a 
dense foundation and prepare myself to be a fine and of high quality 
Web Developer.

I am committed to work and solve one Data Structure and Algorithm 
problem daily despite of my busy schedule with Lighthouse Labs
Web Development Bootcamp.

I will be referencing on the following websites and will add more
in the future:

  1. https://www.freecodecamp.org
  2. https://www.codewars.com
  3. https://leetcode.com
  4. from Lighthouse Labs Exercises
  5. https://www.udacity.com
 
Also, helping aspiring Web Developer discover / practice / enhance 
their problem solving skills is another reason why I created this
repository.

Happy Coding...
