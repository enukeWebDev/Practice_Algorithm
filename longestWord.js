//Find the longest word length Algorithm
const findLongestWordLength = str => {
  let newStr = str.split(' ');

  //console.log(newStr); - use for debugging purpose
  //for of loops is simple & perfect if all element in the array is needed to be looked into
  for (let newSt of newStr) {
    //for (let i = 0; i < newStr.length; i++) - can use a traditional for loops here as well

}
//Tests
console.log(findLongestWordLength('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'));//Output: 6
console.log(findLongestWordLength('Maybe Iâ€™m missing something but I tried it as above and did not work.'));//Output: 9
console.log(findLongestWordLength('I would personally recommend the first solution for readability to others.'));//Output: 11
